Using RNNs: time series prediction and text generation
==================


In this project I'll build Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first I'll use real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using a simple RNN model implemented in Keras. The second one will be trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel =) This project is part of the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ucaiado/rnn_predictions/blob/0da93b942f39e19539a1d87631bb1b437a1291c3/aind2/RNN_project.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.
